#+TITLE: OrgNotes

This application gives you mobile web access to your [[https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/OrgMode][Org Mode]] stored in Dropbox. Notes are parsed
and displayed with nicer styles, using the great [[https://github.com/mooz/org-js][org-js]] parser.

* FAQ

** Does it have full access to my Dropbox?
   No, Dropbox permissions are limited to the applications directory. This means the app cannot access the rest of your files at all.

** Does it support other formats?
   Markdown support is comming soon, in case you have some legacy notes ;-)

** How to I use it?
   Right now there is no public hosted instance, but you can easily run the
   application using the provided docker image. Just register your own [[https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps][Dropbox
   application]] and complete the =docker-compose.yml= file with the corresponding
   credentials. Then run:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   docker-compose up
   #+END_SRC
